# DNA_SEQ

# Setup

-   Clone this repo from the `main` branch

- Move to the `src` folder and create your dev environment using `config.yml` and then activate it.

PS: We assume that you already have `anaconda` installed, otherwise you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cGsPxVKEJI) tutorial to have it installed and running on your WSL machine. 

```bash
$ cd src
$ conda create --file config.yml
$ conda activate asp
(asp) $ 
```

- The last line is the final result you are supposed to get.

- At this point you might be able to run all the scripts in `src`.

```
